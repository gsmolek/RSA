# RSA algorithm
 C++ implementation of the RSA asymetric algorithm.
 ## RSA
 Is a public-key algorithm used to encrypt data with a public key and decrypt it with a private key.
 ### Decryption and decryption
 If user A wants to send a message to user B, He must know the public key of user B and encrypt the message with it.
 When user B receives the encrypted message he can decrypt it with his private-key and view the original message.
 ### How to use
 To create both the private-key and public-key pair use:
 
 ### Key size 
 Currently supports 512 and 1024 bits length keys.
 
 ### Dependencies
 Depandant on boost libararies.
